This Group Support System (GSS) microservice is part of the foundations of the Researcher Hub platform. It manages user member's accounts, member's workgroups and decisions, and member's mailer settings. The git repository contains [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) definitions for high-growth startups and companies to consume SaaS services on the Researcher Hub platform to enhance their current services and offerings.

Researcher Hub is a collaborative online research workspace that uses advanced language-based AI agents and Big Data to tailor the delivery of behavioural apps in any digital modality. The platform is based on original work done developed in 2017-2018, as part of a PhD project.

The current features are as follows:

+ **Accounts**: RESTful APIs for user member's sessions, user researcher login, user accounts, password management, and user verification.

+ **Workgroups**: RESTful APIs for managing research workgroups and facilitate groups.

+ **Voting**: RESTful APIs on advance voting and ballot mechanisms for workgroups to help facilitate consensus and overcome group conflicts [work-in-progress].

+ **Mailer**: RESTful APIs containing email communication settings for individual Researcher Hub account holders.
